# Introduction
In the year of 2020 or 2021: 
 - we read about the book Two Years of My Life. 

In Python, a variable like year=2000 will be treated as a <class 'int'>. 
 - Once integers are converted to strings, we can rename the book as "2000: Two Years of My Life"

Do we have a picture? Yes! 
 - ![pic]({pic})
Do we have a picture now? No... 
 - No Pic For You!
